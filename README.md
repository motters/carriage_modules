# Carriage Hub System Schematics
This repo contains basic schematics for the carriage hub system.

Due to the system using modular electronics the diagrams are basic block diagrams to give a general over view.

To keep the diagrams simple, basic connections like power and gnd have been removed.

Power regulation block that shows 12v in is a block diagram for the "battery backup and external supply". This is actually 32V in or a 8-12V battery.

The diagrams are part of Sam's join / group Microcontrollers unit coursework (although stored on Sam's GitHub profile for ease of marking).
